I've successfully extended the simple demo HTML page to a complete landing page using pure HTML and pure CSS (inline in a `<style>` tag).

**Key Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Tailwind CSS** - The page now uses only vanilla CSS with no external dependencies

2. **Added Complete Landing Page Sections:**
   - **Header** - Fixed navigation with logo and nav links
   - **Hero Section** - Eye-catching gradient background with call-to-action buttons
   - **Features Section** - 6 feature cards with icons showcasing product benefits
   - **About Section** - Company info with statistics (customers, uptime, API requests)
   - **Testimonials** - 3 client testimonials with avatars
   - **CTA Section** - Final call-to-action with gradient background
   - **Footer** - Multi-column footer with links and copyright

3. **Design Decisions:**
   - Used a modern color scheme with blue/purple gradients
   - Implemented responsive design with mobile breakpoints
   - Added smooth hover transitions and animations
   - Used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
   - Included system fonts for optimal performance
   - Created hover effects on cards and buttons for interactivity

The landing page is now fully functional and ready to use!
