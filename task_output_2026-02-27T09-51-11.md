Task started: 1772185872521
Successfully created a simple HTML file with Tailwind CSS. The file includes:

1. **HTML Structure**: A clean HTML5 document with proper meta tags for charset and viewport
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated via CDN (cdn.tailwindcss.com) for quick setup without build tools
3. **Page Content**:
   - A centered card layout with a white background and shadow
   - A heading "Welcome to Demo"
   - A descriptive paragraph
   - An interactive button with hover effects

**Design Decisions**:
- Used Tailwind CDN for simplicity and quick demo purposes (no build step required)
- Used a centered flexbox layout with a light gray background for visual appeal
- Added hover effects to the button for better user interaction feedback
- Used semantic HTML5 elements

The file is located at: `/Users/robertbenak/Projects/mimic/MimicCoder/server/directors/44668a11-c588-47d3-b3fc-18564f41ef9e/index.html`
